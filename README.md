# PyTorchForDeepLearning
This repository is a collection of codes, that I practiced, while attending freecodecamp.org's webinar on PyTorchForDeepLearning: ZeroToGANs from instructor Aakaash, founder of Jovian.  
The code is occasionaly commented at the place which are technical and is avaible for usage and modifications.
